This material aims to teach principles and understanding fundamental to study of Computer Science, and programming in general.  It is intended to be used by an instructor in a hand-on and interactive setting, accesible to motivated beginners, but useful to those with programming experience.  It is not a tutorial or a getting started guide for a particular language, paradigm, or application, and instlead covers general fundamentals.  It is also not exhaustive, and other course material may be created in the future for more in-depth studies of any or all of the topics covered in this material.

The philosophy of this material is that Computer Scientists need to have an understanding of both mathematical theory (the "top" or "high level") and inner machine workings (the "bottom" or "low level") and practical applications of both.
